		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Pitbulls are known to be a very aggressive breed. Coming from a house that was completely against
		Pitbulls in the past I used to be able to side with that statement. Now I live in a house with 
		6 dogs. One is a pure bread Pitbull and 4 others are American Bullies that are part Pitbull.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Any dog, depending on how you raise it, could become aggressive. 
		If you raise them to be nice they could still turn out mean but the odds of that happening are slimmer than
		if you were to raise it differently. My pitbull is the sweetest guy and the worst he would ever do to you is lick you to death.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Now you can probably see that if someone were to come to me and say that Pitbulls are aggressive and mean I would
		probably go into a long story about how I used to think that too. I would explain to them
		I have the nicest Pitbulls and if they ever met them their whole opinions would change.
